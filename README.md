# Template-Matching
A C++ implementation of template matching without image processing libraries like OpenCV. This is one of our course labs.
Only .bmp images support. Your can compile the OBJ.cpp on Windows with environment that supports the C++20 standard.
The process is: read the bitmap file--> filtering and scaling --> calculate ncc --> output the result.
